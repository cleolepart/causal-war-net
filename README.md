# A Causal War Net

A causal and computational framework for modeling the emergence of large-scale conflict,
grounded in Christopher Clark’s *The Sleepwalkers* and extended toward generalizable
geopolitical forecasting.

Initial focus: World War I as a historical case study.

Long-term goal: event-driven, actor-based models capable of forward simulation
and uncertainty-aware forecasting.
